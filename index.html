                    I am currently a 3rd year student majoring in Statistics at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I created this website due to my continous interests in learning and exploring new programming languages. In the future my objective is to connect this website to a database and learn server-side script languages (PHP), with the help of RDBMS such as MySQL.

                    This is a Tableau dashboard of my current NHL fantasy hockey team and crucial statistics that can help inform me on the performance and value of my players.
                    I extracted the data such that it included player's statistics (goals, assists, TOI, Shot percentage, etc.) from 2016, 2017 and 2018. I then created the dashboard that could filter
                    depending on which player is chosen, using the filter bar on the right. This would indicate the location of the team that they  play in on the map, and it will also highlight their
                    statisitics accordingly. Including goals in the 2016-2018, proportion to all my players and the distribution of their points in terms of goals and assists.

                    <a>This is my personal website that I use to document and display interesting projects to the public. Although I am not mainly a Computer Science student, it was 
                        fascinating thought to be able to learn HTML and CSS to create a personalized website where I am in control. It also helps my comptency in adpating to new languages 
                        when needed. In the future I hope to use bootstrap to make the website even more responsive and connect this website to a database.
